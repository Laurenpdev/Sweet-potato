        <h3>People</h3>
        <p>I have always been enamored by human connection, what makes us tick, and what brings us joy.
        I have a knack at carrying on an enjoyable conversation with a client while simulataneously processing their payment,
        scheduling their appointments for three weeks out, and printing their receipt.
        I'm that person that keeps listening to your story at the party after Chad started to talk over you, and I make sure you get to finish because I AM listening.

        </p>

      <div class="skill-row">
        <h3>Admin and Operations</h3>
        <p>Backed up by over a decade of working in customer service or customer relations positions, I learn fast, can put the information into action immediately,
          and do it all with a smile. As I've gotten older, I've learned to slow down, enjoy the process more, and make sure to bring my team back up for air.
          I am a master multi-tasker, but excel if I can really dig into just 2 things rather than 6. I am comfortable on the phone, comfortable taking feedback, and enjoy staying busy.
      </p>
      <div class="skill-row">
        <h3>Tech</h3>
        <p>All aspects of Google, Word, PDF, admin basics.
          HTML, CSS, Boot Strap, (so far!)
          Google UX Design Certificate.
          A good handle on Crypto (and excited to keep learning)
